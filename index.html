                            <p>I am a recent graduate from the <b>University of Nottingham</b> with a Bachelor's degree in Business Management. During my degree, I had the opportunity to complete a placement year in Germany at <b>Sirius Facilities GmbH</b>, a real estate company, where I worked primarily within the marketing department. This experience allowed me to sharpen my marketing skills across both digital and traditional platforms.</p>
                            <p>From managing website design and content updates using <b>WordPress and Beaver Builder</b>, to developing <b>physical branding and advertising campaigns</b>, I gained hands-on experience in a wide range of marketing activities.</p>
                            <p>With this strong foundation, I have now set up as a freelancer, offering a range of marketing services tailored to meet the unique needs of businesses. Whether you need web alterations, content creation, or creative advertising strategies, I'm here to help you grow your brand and reach your audience effectively.</p>

                            <p>I had the opportunity to bring that creativity to life through various advertisements and campaigns. One of my most notable projects was a rebranding campaign for mylager, a self-storage company under the Sirius brand.</p>
                            <p>The challenge was unique: mylager had only existed online, with no physical presence or brand recognition. My first task was conducting market research to identify key competitors and develop a strategy to position mylager in a competitive market. Once we pinpointed our target audience, the next step was to create a compelling visual and slogan for the brand’s physical launch.</p>
                            <p>Among three shortlisted ideas, my concept was chosen to represent the face of the campaign. I based the idea around traditional dolls—often seen as creepy across different cultures—with a slogan encouraging people to store away what’s cluttering their homes. Seeing my concept selected for a nationwide campaign was an incredible experience.</p>
                            <p>One of my favourite campaigns was for storage and office billboard advertisements placed near a Burger King. I saw an opportunity to tap into the playful rivalry with McDonald's, incorporating clever wordplay and visual elements. The office ad featured the slogan "Unsere Büros Werden Sie BIGMAChen" (Our offices will make you BIG), while the storage ad cleverly depicted McDonald’s iconic fry box, but with items representing storage space emerging from it, tied together with mylager’s red color scheme—closely mirroring McDonald's branding.</p>
                            <p>Each project pushed my creative boundaries, enhancing my ability to generate innovative ideas and execute them effectively. These experiences have deepened my love for marketing and creativity, and I’m excited to bring this level of passion and ingenuity to future projects.</p>
